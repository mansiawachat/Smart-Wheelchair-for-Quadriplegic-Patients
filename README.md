# Smart-Wheelchair-for-Quadriplegic-Patients


# Abstract -
The health service sector has been continuously trying to prove and improve the service given to the Quadriplegic Patients in need of mobility
assistance. As a result, more Efforts have been directed towards development of smart wheelchairs. This project aims to design a wheelchair which
is controlled by a wireless connected Smartphone via Voice which replicates
the commands given by the patients through a secure dedicated Web server
to the wheelchair. The patients will be able to move their wheelchairs forward, back, right or left at a designated speed. The Wheelchair would be
employed with various health monitoring systems such as ECG, Heart rate,
Pulse, etc. All the health related information collected from these sensors
would be displayed on a website accessible for doctors and patient’s relatives. It would also have state-of-the-art safety features facilitated by
proximity sensor, Gyroscopic sensor, IR Line following sensor and a safety
latch. A Gimbal mechanism would also be added to ensure a stabilized leveled movement of the wheelchair over an uneven path. Arduino uno will
act as the brain as it will control the movement and gather information
from various sensors. 

# Limitations of existing system - 
Several researchers have proposed various innovative systems for wheelchair
control. Prof. Rajesh Kannan has proposed a camera-based system that
tracks finger movements to control the direction of the wheelchair. Aleksandar Pajkanovic and Branko Dokic have designed a robotic wheelchair that
can be controlled using head gestures, which are detected by an accelerometer and a microcontroller. Sobia M. Carmel has developed a facial recognition system that enables the user to control the wheelchair using face
detection, facial expression recognition, and command generation. Klabi
has illustrated the use of voice commands and facial movements to control
the wheelchair, along with sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance.
Lastly, Andrej Skraba has presented a cloud-based wheelchair platform ˇ
that can be controlled through speech using a low-cost WebKit. We have
implemented several innovative and new features in addition to the previously researched voice control mechanism. The biggest novelty being
application of Mecanum wheels for increased mobility. In order to ensure
Patient’s utmost comfort we also have executed and fine]-tuned a gimbal
stabilization to the wheelchair. An additional modernization also being
the implementation of IOT to the wheelchair, which shares vital medical
statistics of the patient to the concerned authorities via a secure network
and server. 
# Problem Statement - 
To Develop a wheelchair for quadriplegics patients who are unable to use
their arms and legs due to Quadriplegia, track their medical statistics with
the help of sensors, and provide a comfortable ride with the help of a
self-stabilizing gimbal. 

# Solution 
Our system’s main goal is to provide freedom of mobility to the Quadriplegic
patients and the other patients in need. Our initiative aims to help patients
overcome their disability and contribute to the medical profession.
• Monitoring the health of patients: Health sensors can be used to keep
an eye on patients’ wellbeing. which can help doctors determine the
appropriate course of action.
• Multiple Sensors: We use several sensors to gather all the information
required, receive vocal orders from the patient, and carry out the task.
• Mobility and Stability: The movement mechanism is equipped with a
mechanum wheel and gimbal for the patients’ safety. All-directional
movement is provided by the mechanical wheel, while three-axis stability is provided by the gimbal’s usage of gyro sensors.
