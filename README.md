# Smart-Wheelchair-for-Quadriplegic-Patients


# Abstract 
The health service sector has been continuously trying to prove and improve the service given to the Quadriplegic Patients in need of mobility
assistance. As a result, more Efforts have been directed towards development of smart wheelchairs. This project aims to design a wheelchair which
is controlled by a wireless connected Smartphone via Voice which replicates
the commands given by the patients through a secure dedicated Web server
to the wheelchair. The patients will be able to move their wheelchairs forward, back, right or left at a designated speed. The Wheelchair would be
employed with various health monitoring systems such as ECG, Heart rate,
Pulse, etc. All the health related information collected from these sensors
would be displayed on a website accessible for doctors and patientâ€™s relatives. It would also have state-of-the-art safety features facilitated by
proximity sensor, Gyroscopic sensor, IR Line following sensor and a safety
latch. A Gimbal mechanism would also be added to ensure a stabilized leveled movement of the wheelchair over an uneven path. Arduino uno will
act as the brain as it will control the movement and gather information
from various sensors.
